# Engineering notes

Field notes, verified facts, and lessons. Read before nontrivial changes; keep current.
(Seeded from the planning session that designed this pipeline, 2026-07-07.)

## PDF field notes (verified on the four test books)

- **Page boxes vary per page**; read them per page, never document-level. Printer slug
  lines (".indd", "Page iv", date/time) sit OUTSIDE the TrimBox on older Fons Vitae PDFs
  (Book of Knowledge, Me and Rumi) but poppler/PyMuPDF still extract them → clip lines by
  TrimBox and keep the clipped lines as evidence.
- **/PageLabels are usually broken**: of the four test books, only Harmonious Unity's are
  clean. Book of Knowledge skips v–vi; Me and Rumi labels its cover spread "i" (off-by-one);
  Islam and Buddhism uses InDesign section labels ("Sec1:7"). The folio-vs-label agreement
  check runs on every book; `label_source: printed-folios` is a routine tool.
- **PUA codepoints** (U+E000–F8FF) come from symbol fonts ("Honorifics" → U+F048 for the
  ﷺ honorific). Every PUA char needs an agent-verified substitution recorded in
  glyphs.pua_map with a "verified on p.N render" note. Ornament dividers likewise.
- **Outline titles can carry trailing \x00 padding** (BoK, InDesign CS6) — strip NULs and
  whitespace.
- **Lost spaces in old prepress PDFs** (Me and Rumi, Creo Normalizer, no ToUnicode):
  `say,"If I`, `Erzincan.They`. Deterministic restore_spaces (initials-protected) repairs
  the common patterns; count every insertion; residuals escalate — never hand-edit text.
- **Small caps are separate fonts** (Bembo-SC, Gentium-SC700, TimesNewRomanPSMT-SC700).
  Text extracts with correct casing; render with a font-level smallcaps charstyle flag,
  never case-transform.
- **Drop caps extract as detached oversized 1–2 char lines** ("A" / "lmost…", BoK
  Foreword). Flow reattaches them; paragraph gets class first-dropcap.
- **Vertical CJK extracts column-interleaved** (Harmonious Unity Liu Zhi pages). v1 policy:
  those pages become figure pages (raster + alt), like idml2epub did; inline CJK mixed into
  Latin front matter stays live text with Noto substitutes.
- **Link annotations**: filter to internal GoTo; URI links exist in the wild (BoK has 4).
- Engine cross-check: PyMuPDF (primary) vs poppler pdftotext per-page similarity is the
  extraction-confidence signal. Engines witness, never co-author: disagreement flags a page
  for render review; nothing auto-merges.

## Verification baselines

- Smoke counts (extract): BoK 338 pp / 79 outline / 83 GoTo links; Me and Rumi 441 / 0 / 32;
  Islam and Buddhism 170 / 0 / 0; Harmonious Unity 152 / 70 / 68.
- Coverage gate: ≥99% vs poppler ground truth (footnote bodies stripped from ground truth
  per page — they move to endnotes; gate 3 verifies each note on its page and guards the
  circularity). The itemized missing-segment list is the real audit.

## Refinement loop (inherited from idml2epub)

- Preserve init's draft (book.draft.yaml); the draft-vs-final diff measures heuristic quality.
- A correction seen in two books becomes a heuristic; a misfiring heuristic becomes a code
  fix + unit test; every human-found gate gap must become a check or a written reason.
- Reproducibility: fixed zip timestamps, uuid5 identifier (`pdf2epub:{slug}` seed),
  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH pinned in core/fonts.py; wipe build/oebps each build (stale files ship).
  Reproducibility is scoped to the same toolchain — record PyMuPDF + poppler versions in
  the build log.

## Open items

- Live vertical-CJK flow (v2; figure pages for now).
- RTL live text: detect + warn + escalate (unimplemented, same as idml2epub).
- OCR for image-only pages: out of scope; such pages ship as figures when the agent can
  verify content from the render, else escalate.
- Multi-column body text: detected + escalated, not converted.
